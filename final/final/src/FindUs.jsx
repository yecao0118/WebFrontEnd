                            In this ARG game, you'll step into the shoes of an applicant participating in a special talent recruitment test for the mixed-reality game company, Vapor.
                            This company is a metaverse gaming company, but they aspire to achieve much more than what meets the eye...
                            <br /> <br /> <br />
                            You'll need to unearth all clues about Vapor, including their products, employees' social media, interviews with leaders, and perhaps even resort to unconventional methods,
                            like hacking into specific systems. Your ultimate goal is to uncover Vapor's hidden operations and the true purpose behind this recruitment,
                            and successfully qualify for the recruitment program.
                            <br /> <br /> <br />
                            Remember, this test is just the beginning. After unlocking the secrets of Vapor's clandestine employees, you must obtain crucial keys to embark on a long-term investigation.
