          <p>In the planning of "Code Echo", we were honored that the concept of ARG was recognized by HiPhi, and we quickly reached a cooperation to link it with HiPhi's future concept car HiPhi Z in level design. Players need to find a car from the future 2045 at the conference site and enter the data transmission point, and the transmission password is located where HiPhi Z is.<br/> <br/> </p>
          <p>In addition, players also need to secretly connect with Code Echo special operators on site, drink a cup of coffee together, listen to the message on the speaker, and obtain a special key.</p>
